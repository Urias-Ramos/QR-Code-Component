## My process
This was a simple challenge, but I had a couple of complications, such as importing the font used and applying the margins to the QR image.
What I did was separate the styles into a separate style.css file.
split sections like image and texts

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to import fonts using a URL, it seems silly but I had never done it.

This is how I did it:

```bash
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400..700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Continued development

I'm still having trouble understanding the concept of screens, this is the area I'm focused on improving.
